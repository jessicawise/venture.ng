## Venture.ng Application Design

The idea was to create an application for people interested in tabletop to be able to play with friends or family that are in different locations. Tabletop is a fun experience and no one should be left out just because they can't attend an in person game session. There are some tools out now that players and game masters use but often times they are pricey or very frustrating to use.

I wanted to create an application that is easy to use, easy to access and has all of the information needed for whatever ruleset is decided for the game.

### Time Constraint

5 weeks

## User Research

For my user research, I conducted several in person interviews and put out a survey on a tabletop reddit.

I found that there are a lot of people already playing virtual tabletop games and are not at all adverse to not having a physical tabletop system. However, there are aspects of physical tabletop that players and game masters alike would like to have such as physical dice and game ruleset books. 

At the same time, there are problems that cross between a physical tabletop game and a virtual tabletop game that cause snags during gameplay for everyone. I found that a lot of players have a lot of trouble with calculating numbers on their character sheets and during combat. This fact causes game masters distress because it takes forever then for a player to be ready and that means lost time during a game. Players, though, are not the only ones with problems. Game masters also have to go through alot of steps to get a game ready from prepping maps and tokens to figuring out what they're going to run for a game. With many different places to find information it isn't easy for players or game masters to be 100% ready for a game.

The main problem comes down to: How can a complex tabletop system be made easy to use for both players and game masters?

## User Testing

The things I thought were great, were not! But that was completely perfect. The feedback was englightening and made me rethink a lot of the design choices I had made. Little known fact, I like iterating on my wireframes! 

The main feedback: "The widgets on the game board are too small. I don't feel like I'll have enough space to see all of the important information, especially on the map."

Normally, a table top game map on a Virtual Table Top system spans the whole screen. It allows the user to pan around the map and zoom in and zoom out. My original idea was to ax that as I was going to have other elements that could be positioned around the page and I didn't want the user to feel like everything was overlapping too much. However, table top players like their large maps. So I axed my own idea and changed it so that user could resize their map, as long as it wasn't too small, and allow them to collapse and expand other widgets to give them optimal viewing space. 

Next important feedback: "The bar at the top of the game board screen isn't clear that it means a new window will be opened up. In that aspect, opening a new window would be the same as putting a bar up top that allows the user to change their settings. By the way, why can't I change my game board settings here?"

This was a very valid point. I had only given the user the option to change their game settings outside of the game board. That makes no sense! Each game would have their own settings based on the user's preference for that game's play style. Maybe in one game the user isn't using video at all and as such wouldn't even need the video widget anymore. This also brought to light, in pairing with the previous feedback, that the Data Library widget was going to suffer if left on the game board. There was going to be too much information to be displayed in a widget. So I changed the idea of new window, gave the user a dropdown bar that allows them to open a new window with the data library, change their settings and exit the game board. Exiting the game board would return the user to their Games page instead of closing the application completely.

## Future Features

<strong>Game Master Specific Game Board</strong><br />
Game Masters run the game and create the world and as such they need to have access to different assets than players do.

<strong>Character Sheet Onboarding</strong><br />
Character sheets are hard and most players aren’t good at traversing a ruleset’s player guides. A guided Character Sheet creation would chop off some time when creating a character.

<strong>Ruleset Based Data Library</strong><br />
Players are bad at even obtaining player guide books. Not all information for each ruleset is avaliable online either. A centralized Data Library would give players without access to the books, the information they need.

<strong>Friends</strong><br />
Not everyone has friends or habitually checks the looking for group reddit and these people also need a way to play tabletop (even with strangers). The idea would be to create a board within the website for GM’s and Players to recruit each other for games.
